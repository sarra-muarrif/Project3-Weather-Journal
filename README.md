# :sunny: :cloud: :umbrella: Weather-Journal App Project

## :memo:Overview:
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI  in a Weather Journal application. 

## :pushpin:Instructions:
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## :inbox_tray: Project Environment setup
* ## Node and Express Environemnt:
    * In this project we are using Node and Express environemnts. Node and Express should be installed on the local machine. The project file server.js should require express(), and should create an instance of their app using express.
    The Express app instance should be pointed to the project folder with .html, .css, and .js files.

* ## Project Dependencies:
   * The ‘cors’ package should be installed in the     project from the command line, required in the project file server.js, and the instance of the app should be setup to use cors().
   The body-parser package should be installed and included in the project.

## :hammer: Building
### To get the project up and running I followed these steps:

1. Setting up project environment, making sure I have Node and packages installed, and included in my server.js file.
2. Added POST and GET routes to ensure correct retrieval of data from the server.
3. Acquired API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website.
4. Created async functions to fetch weather data and store it on my local server.
5. Set up a function that updated UI dynamically.

## :computer: Running the App:
1. fork and clone the repository.
2. open the index.html file in browser.
3. running server in termanial by command node server.js
